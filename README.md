## The ISR Summer School Application Website

This is a web application for accepting applications to the ISR Summer School. It is written as a Python Flask backend and a Javascript React client in the browser.


History
-------

For 2019 and earlier, we used a Django App for serving the announcement and application website. This is all contained within the "workshop" directory.

For 2020 and onward, we started using a React app with a flask backend.
