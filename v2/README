Update the 2020 school site for 2021.


- copied v1 into v2.
-- changed all paths in venvs files to replace "v1" with "v2"
- changed REACT_APP_ROOT_URL in devel/frontend
- updated the text in devel/frontend/src/pages/home/HomePage.js for 2021 school and renabled the "apply" button by changing the 0 to a 1 in the if statement
- updated the text in the files in devel/backend/server/routes/templates/api
- change "v1" to "v2" in restart
- modified /etc/supervisord.d/isr_school.ini to autostart the v2 prod site, but never autostart the v1 nor the devel sites
